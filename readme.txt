== Description ==

This plugin uses BuddyPress's notification system to let users subscribe to all new posts on a site (or many sites if you run Multisite). When a new post is published all users subscribed to the site gets a notification and optionally an email (can be turned off in their BuddyPress email settings).

== Installation ==

Install it via the plugin directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with multisite and single site? =

Yes! It works great with both! :) But it's probably most useful for multisite where users might have a hard time to get an overview of all sub-sites/blogs.
